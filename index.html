    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="home-content">
        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Lachlan</strong>, a Cybersecurity Specialist with a passion for protecting systems and networks from emerging threats. With a strong foundation in networking, SIEM tools, and security practices, I've honed my skills in vulnerability assessment, system hardening, and web application security. My journey began with a Certificate IV in Cybersecurity from Monash University, supplemented by hands-on experience in ethical hacking competitions and CTFs (Capture The Flag), where I tackled real-world challenges in penetration testing and network defense.</p>
        
        <p>Before diving into cybersecurity, I built a background in customer service and event management, skills that have proven invaluable in fast-paced, client-focused environments. This experience has helped me develop a sharp ability to adapt, collaborate, and thrive under pressure—skills I apply every day in the world of cybersecurity.</p>
        
        <p>The journey has been a rewarding one, involving countless hours of study, networking protection projects, and honing my technical skills. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and take on new challenges, particularly in optimizing security operations and strengthening defenses. My goal is to contribute to the development of innovative, real-world security solutions, and I firmly believe in the power of teamwork to achieve this.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve created this website as a space to showcase my work, projects, and the latest trends in cybersecurity. Whether you're looking to learn more about me, explore my past and current projects, or stay up to date with the latest developments in the field, you’re in the right place. My exclusive blog will provide insights on cybersecurity news, tips, and trends. So keep checking back to stay informed.</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to reach out if you have questions, want to collaborate, or just want to chat about the latest in cyber defense. Thanks for visiting!</p>
